This package helps prevent performance problems with duplicated Policy calls within your application lifecycle. To achieve this policy-calls are soft cached after they have run initially. The cache does not cache policy calls through concurrent requests; only duplicated calls within a single request are cached.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require innoge/laravel-policy-soft-cache
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-policy-soft-cache-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * When enabled, the package will cache the results of all Policies in your Laravel application
     */
    'cache_all_policies' => true,
];
```

## Usage

By default, this package caches all policy calls of your entire application. You can disable this behavior by setting the ```cache_all_policies```configuration to false. Now you can specify which Policy classes should be soft cached and which not. If you want your policy to be cached, add the ```Innoge\LaravelPolicySoftCache\Contracts\SoftCacheable``` interface.

For Example:

```
use Innoge\LaravelPolicySoftCache\Contracts\SoftCacheable;

class UserPolicy implements SoftCacheable
{
    ...
}
```

## Clearing the cache
Sometimes you want to clear the policy cache after model changes. You can call the ```Innoge\LaravelPolicySoftCache::flushCache();``` method.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
